SSON - Simulator for SLICE Optical Networks
=========================================

SSON is a powerful tool in the area of elastic optical networks. It can work as basis to the development of routing, spectrum assignment, regenerator assignment and regenerator placement algorithms, and to analyze the impact of several parameters over the network's performance.
